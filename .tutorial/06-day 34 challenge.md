# ðŸ‘‰ Day 34 Challenge

Let's extend this program and build option 4: "Get SPAMMING".

- Print out the first 10 email addresses with a custom email sent to each of those people.
- Print one email at a time, pause, and then clear the screen before the next email is printed.

Example:
```
Dear john@test.com
It has come to our attention that you're missing out on the amazing Replit 100 days of code. We insist you do it right away. If you don't we will pass on your email address to every spammer we've ever encountered and also sign you up to the My Little Pony newsletter, because that's neat. We might just do that anyway.

Love and hugs,
Ian Spammington III

- Use the same libraries, list, and subroutine we just created.
- Create a second subroutine relating to spam. In the `for` loop, we want to spam everyone. What would the `range` look like?
- Write the email copy that will get sent to the email addresses.
- Finish with the same `while` loop we created, but add option 4 (spamming). Make sure you only include 10 emails.
- Don't forget to pause and clear the screen each time.
